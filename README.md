### Developers
Robyn Smith, Jaewon Han, Roshanak Ahmed, and Jeanzle Albalte

## Overview
This is an E-commerce React app project that sells plants. The developers built a plant API with back-end endpoints and connected it to React routes on a front-end proxy server. 

Additional components were created such as the Home page. Customers can also register user accounts and log into the website on the Register and Login pages. Users then have the option to logout of their accounts.

The Plants page shows all the plants from API. When each individual plant is clicked on, users can see all the individual plant data from the API  on a new page.

Users have the option to add comments reviewing each plant. Users may also add plants to their Cart. The admin user is the only user given the option to create new plants and delete existing plants on the Plant page.

The Plant Care page embeds YouTube videos and links external articles on plant care. The Questionnaire tab allows users to take a survey and find out which plant type best suits them.
